 * Structs
 *  This small library introduces structs and their usage, paving the way for
 *  classes. Just because structs predate classes does not mean they are no
 *  longer used and used outside C++. They see lots of use in Javascript, for
 *  instance, additionally, database frameworks often use them to store
 *  retrieved rows.
 *
 * + Person: struct representing a person as a
 *   + first name : std::string,
 *   + last name : std::string, and
 *   + date of birth : Date.
 *
 * + Date: struct representing a date
 *   + year : unsigned int,
 *   + month : unsigned int, and
 *   + day : unsigned int.
 *
 * Functions:
 *  In the past, functions were often grouped with structs. This is what led to
 *  member functions or methods. This library presents a few reasonable
 *  functions one might expect to have provided with the structs.
